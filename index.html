              I am currently attending Rochester Institute of Technology where I am pursuing a major in Game Design and Development, alongside a minor in Computer Science.
              I enjoy learning how to use new technology to create whatever my mind is able to think of. I am always eager to utilize the skills I acquire to solve problems,
              streamline a process, or bring new experiences to people across the world.

                    Discord Duels is a text based MMORPG game I began developing in my senior year of highschool as a Rock-Paper-Scissors chat bot in the Discord messaging application. As the game grew in popularity I began to add additional features including an inventory system, leveling/progression, and story based quests.
                    <br><br>
                        Since creation the game has been added to thousands of discord servers, played by 10s of thousands of individual users, and continues to expand each day.

                    Tentatively named Lost Ones, this is a 2D Action Platformer being built with Unity. For this game I am adopting the turn based system of Discord Duels to create a combat system that provides intimate encounters with enemies while still giving players the freedom that a 2D platformer would provide   
                    <br><br>
                        In addition to the combat system the game will additionally feature aspects of customization, both in gameplay and cosmetics, along side procedurally generated dungeons and story affiliated missions that serve as checkpoints on player progression.

                    Green is a endless shoot-em-up made for a 48-hour game jam at my university. The theme of the game was simply the color green so I decided to make a game in which the player must transfer their "green energy" into enemies to defeat them while also making sure that they don't run out of energy themselves.
                    <br><br>
                        The game was a finalist at the game jam earning the title of "Best Gameplay". Along side the endless aspect of defeating enemies, players are able to accumulate the points they earn to unlock passives that allow them to last longer in the game.

                    Originally developed as a spin-off of asteroids for a final project in my 9th grade computer science class, Bullet Hell is 2D space shoot-em-up developed in Processing, a Java based language, in which the player must defend a central space station from an onslaught of alien invaders. After completing this project for the class, I occasionally returned to add features such as a camera and an ability system.

                        Upon learning Unity I recreated a simple version of the game in 3D as a way to teach myself some of Unity's basics.
